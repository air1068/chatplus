# Chat+
In Amazing Cultivation Simulator's social minigame, the Chat button has a 30% chance to tell you the name of someone the NPC is interested in, and a 21% chance to tell you a bit of information they know that you haven't learned yet.

Chat+ is a mod that adds two buttons, "Gossip" and "Pry", to the social minigame UI that let you get the info you want 100% of the time, saving you many clicks. (This has no effect on gameplay other than bypassing the aforementioned 30%/21% randomness; that is, all it does is give you the same messages you could see by clicking Chat repeatedly.)
